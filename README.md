## Introduction

### Feelings about the homework
I appreciated doing this work, it learned me many useful tools that i didn't know. I thought i was very good in python but it is still many things i have to learn.
It brings me knowleadge of tools like _named tuple_, _deque_, _Counter from collections_ (that i use a lot in next exercices after discover it) and _zip_ (that i already knew but didn't know how powerful it was).
I also appreciated the part on regex because in my last internship i had been asked to use _regular expression_ but i didn't really train myself on it they only gave me the site _Regex 101_ and let me alone without more explanations. So i am very glad that i could train myself on different exercices like those in HackerRank.

## Exercices

### Note about exercices that can't succed all tests :

##### Set, .discard(), .remove(), .pop()
This one was very simple but i don't know why my code is not running properly. I tried many differents possibilities never succesfully. I finally have a look on the _Discussion_ part of the exercice to see if people get the same problem but no one mentioned it. I try to run a code that should be working (giving in the _Discussion_) but still not working on my console... This one is a mystery.

##### Time Delta
This one was very tricky and i was very disapointed regarding the final result.
I found it very interesting and then passed a long time on it, i wanted to make it very clear with functions etc...
I get an _Wrong answer_ so i used 5 hackos to see my mystake. I don't understand why my code is wrong. I don't know why but HackerRank print "Wrong answer" because i launched my code with **_test against custom value_** using **datas of one of the tests that was wrong** and i get **the exactly same results for random templates of the test** (you can try by launching my code). Maybe there is one that not working but i can't find i comparing my result and the expecting one.
(So i am a litle bit frustrated on this one).

##### Word Order
As Time Delta i passed a long time on this one. The first solution i made was simple and based on dictionnary : keys were words and values were occurences/frequences. Then i just had to print the length of the keys() to know the number of differents words and print the values for the number of occurencies. The result was a TimeOut Error. I thought is was due to the fact that my algorithm was comparing strings that took a long time. That is why i try an ASCII version of my code in order to accelerate calculs. But got the same result.


### Note about exercices i can't succed at all :

I have finally unsucceed 7 exercices and i describe in this section which they are and why.

##### XML exercices
All XML or HTML exercices were very hard for me. In fact this was the first time i manipulated those objects and i never coded HTML or XML. I finally success few of them in the regex parts but those in XML were to hard. Like the regex, i try to learn about it on the net but i would take a huge amount of time to learn deeply how to code XML. But i think i will learn more during the year.

##### Hard exercices in Regex
I honestly try the _Validating postal codes_ but this one was too hard for me. Likewise the _Matrix Script_ that i didn't really understand.

##### Decorators 2
Like the XML, i didn't know at all about decorators. I followed the _12 points_ to learn about decorators which allow me to success first exercice with _wrapp@_ command. But for the second exercice i didn't get any idea how to solve it.
